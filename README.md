# Ollama
 Get up and running with large language models. Ollama is a lightweight, open-source tool that lets you run AI language models locally on your own computer. Ollama originally emphasized local model usage, they have added an optional cloud-hosted service (“Cloud Preview”) that lets you run models on datacenter hardware.
